      <description>1. The idea. The year was 2010. In a dazzling display of human ingenuity, the world was introduced to a $2 million grape-peeling machine.
 Though this came out more than a decade ago, I am fascinated by the concept of a remotely-controlled &amp;ldquo;avatar&amp;rdquo;. Particularly in the field of healthcare, I think such robots will transform telemedicine and help bring much-needed treatment capabilities to regions with few trained physicians.</description>

      <description>The assignment this week was to cast something using a mold made from Sorta-Clear 37, a food-safe 2-part silicone rubber. I wanted to make some chocolate coins, since this only required a small 1-sided mold and I wanted to keep some of the Sorta-Clear for some soft robotics experiments in the future.
First, I made a dam with some scrap paper and tape to contain the silicone. I put a half-dollar inside, tail side up (I wanted to cast the tail because it has more detail).</description>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-11-usb-communication/</guid>
      <description>This assignment this week was to get a microcontroller to communicate with a controller over USB. A popular way of visualizing sensor input from a microcontroller is p5, which is a Javascript-based software that can run in the browser. Because I was brand new to p5 at the time, I decided to start with a bare-bones tutorial:
   This tutorial involved controlling a shape drawn in the Chrome browser using a button connected to a microcontroller.</description>

      <title>Week 10 - DIY Closed-Loop Stepper</title>
      <link>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-10-closed-loop-stepper/</link>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-10-closed-loop-stepper/</guid>
      <description>One of the disadvantages of stepper motors is that they are typically open-loop, meaning that the microcontroller does not get feedback as to the position of the stepper. This is a problem because these motors have generally low torque and can easily skip steps, so errors can build up over many movements and result in undesired behavior. However, commercially available closed-loop steppers are fairly expensive (the cheapest ones I found were about $30).</description>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-9-cloud/</guid>
      <description>The assignment this week was to control a microcontroller over Bluetooth or Wifi. This was a perfect opportunity to make progress on my final project (the Avatarm) since my goal was to achieve remote control of the robot arm from anywhere in the world with WiFi. In lab, we learned how to control an LED on a Huzzah from a web portal via a Firebase real-time database.
I really liked how intuitive and reliable Firebase was, so I decided to build on it and see if I could 1) control a servo instead of an LED and 2) send commands from another microcontroller instead of a web portal.</description>

      <title>Week 8 - ESP-NOW Servo Control</title>
      <link>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-8-espnow/</link>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-8-espnow/</guid>
      <description>The assignment for this week was to implement an input/output system over the ESP-NOW radio protocol. I had access to two ESP32 boards: the ESP32-CAM and the Huzzah32. The CAM was a source of many hours of debugging because it does not appear to be optimized for GPIO. Therefore I plan to repeat this project with a standard ESP32 Dev Board or ESP8266, which should be much more straightforward.
I followed this tutorial to set up ESP-NOW.</description>

      <title>Week 8 - OTA with Huzzah32</title>

      <description>Annoyed with having to connect cables to your computer every time you want to push a code update to your Huzzah32? Well, there&amp;rsquo;s this wonderful thing called Arduino OTA (over-the-air) which allows you to upload wirelessly from your home network. This would come in especially handy if, for example, your board is sealed inside some contraption you just 3D-printed.
One of the disadvantages of OTA is that you have to include the code for OTA as part of every sketch you upload.</description>

      <title>Week 7 - Input/Output</title>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-7-input-output/</guid>
      <description>The assignment this week was to create an input-output system, preferably using millis() for timing. Since we recently learned to use the Adafruit TFT display in lab, I decided to build upon my work for the final project to have the TFT display the motor angle. This turned out to be not as simple as simply mashing together the TFT code from here with the servo code from here.
I wanted the display to update at a certain framerate (10 Hz) so the numbers are actually visible on screen for an appreciable amount of time.</description>

      <description>This post will document progress on my efforts to build a dedicated astronomical imaging telescope with star tracking. I will divide the project into two parts: the optical tube assembly (OTA) and the tracking mount.
1. OTA. The OTA is the most important bit, and potentially also the most finicky. Before we begin, it would be a good idea to review how a reflector telescope (the type that uses mirrors instead of lenses) works.</description>

      <title>Week 6 - Capacitive Sensing</title>
      <link>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-6-sensors/</link>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-6-sensors/</guid>
      <description>The goal of this week was to learn how to use sensors in Arduino, with a focus on capacitive sensors. I wanted to do something related to my final project, so I decided to follow a tutorial on making a 3D capacitive motion tracker. I thought that this may have potential applications in hand tracking for the purposes of controlling a robot arm via inverse kinematics.
This is a rather popular project, with tutorials by Make: Magazine as well as others.</description>

      <description>For my final project (link to documentation), I am building a robot arm. Therefore this week I wanted to learn how to control motors using a potentiometer. This was the beginning of a rather convoluted journey, but I learned a lot along the way&amp;hellip;
I wanted to start with one stepper, controlled by one potentiometer. I found a tutorial online for achieving this, and it used an interesting method of continuously checking for changes in the resistance of the potentiometer and applying a step in the same direction as the change.</description>

      <title>Week 5 - Photogrammetry</title>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-5-photogrammetry/</guid>
      <description>Photogrammetry is the 3D reconstruction of an object in the real world using images captured from a camera. Many images are captured of an object from different angles, and special software can be used to estimate the 3D shape of the object. I tried quite a few software options and many did not work with my computer. I finally found success in a program called 3DF Zephyr, which works without the need for an NVIDIA GPU and also has the ability to extract images directly from a video.</description>

      <description>The night sky is truly fascinating to behold. I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to live in a place with relatively little light pollution and there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of stars visible on clear nights. So while stuck at home I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed stargazing. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying my hand at astrophotography, and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten decent results by using my phone to take photos through an old pair of binoculars mounted on a tripod.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in imaging deep sky objects (DSOs), such as nebulae and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Week 3 - Kinetic Sculpture</title>

      <guid>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/week-3-kinetic-sculpture/</guid>
      <description>For this project my task was to make a kinetic sculpture using principles of mechanical design. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the concept of time, and wanted to make something that, like Christopher Nolan movies, could provoke reevaluation of our relationship with time. I also really like clocks (especially old mechanical clocks). So, the natural choice for me was to do something with pendulums.
In particular, I wanted to try to make a perpetually swinging pendulum, oscillating at a much slower speed than constrained by gravity.</description>

      <description>This is an introduction to working with electronic circuits. As a simple exercise, we will calculate the current across an LED in various configurations. The current can be calculated by using Ohm&amp;rsquo;s Law:
We will use both TinkerCAD circuit simulations and real-world measurements, and compare.
Power supply: 3.3 V pin on Metro M0/Arduino
1. No resistor. First, we will determine the current through a single LED bulb with no resistor. The TinkerCAD diagram looks like this:</description>

      <description>For this project we were asked to work in pairs make a press-fit kit out of 2D shapes in cardboard. My partner Jessica and I decided to make a truncated icosahedron (more commonly known as a soccer ball). We chose this shape because it consists of 2 side elements: hexagons and pentagons, and one of us could work on each. After googling around a bit we found an online example of what we wanted to achieve:</description>

      <description>For this project we were asked to model two real-world components in Fusion 360 and create an assembly. I decided to model a PVC bulkhead which I had recently purchased for a hydroponics project. The bulkhead came without a nut, however, so I decided to model &amp;amp; 3D print one myself. Because this was my first time working with Fusion (I previously did all modeling in TinkerCAD), I figured this bulkhead offered a good mix of features to model without being too complicated.</description>

      <description>For my final project, I have a couple of ideas revolving around robotics and control systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with the ability of humans, through technology, to control things outside of our own body. Below are several ideas which I would like to explore.
EEG-controlled robot. I have this toy bluetooth-enabled EEG from a Star Wars Force Trainer kit which I had purchased a while back specifically for the purpose of doing some cool things with in terms of brain-machine interfaces.</description>
