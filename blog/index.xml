      <description>For this project we were asked to work in pairs make a press-fit kit out of 2D shapes in cardboard. My partner Jessica and I decided to make a truncated icosahedron (more commonly known as a soccer ball). We chose this shape because it consists of 2 side elements: hexagons and pentagons, and one of us could work on each. After googling around a bit we found an online example of what we wanted to achieve:</description>

      <title>Week 2: 3D Modeling</title>

      <description>For this project we were asked to model two real-world components in Fusion 360 and create an assembly. I decided to model a PVC bulkhead which I had recently purchased for a hydroponics project. The bulkhead came without a nut, however, so I decided to model &amp;amp; 3D print one myself. Because this was my first time working with Fusion (I previously did all modeling in TinkerCAD), I figured this bulkhead offered a good mix of features to model without being too complicated.</description>

      <description>For my final project, I have a couple of ideas revolving around robotics and control systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with the ability of humans, through technology, to control things outside of our own body. Below are several ideas which I would like to explore.
EEG-controlled robot. I have this toy bluetooth-enabled EEG from a Star Wars Force Trainer kit which I had purchased a while back specifically for the purpose of doing some cool things with in terms of brain-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>Bugs to be Squashed</title>
      <link>https://aspartate.github.io/personal_website/blog/bugs/</link>

      <description>Here are the bugs I need to fix:
 The modals don&amp;rsquo;t work in gallery mode. Also when making a new gallery post I get a weird json error, which goes away when I comment out a block of github stuff. When a blog post is opened, the header menu is in a weird place and covers up some of the text. When a blog post is opened, the next/previous navigation buttons are too close together.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please ignore, this is for my own edification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
