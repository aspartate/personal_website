My name is Andrew Zhang. I’m a junior at Harvard College, and I believe that technological solutions are urgently needed to augment and expand the reach of limited healthcare resources in underserved areas around the world. I’m heavily involved in the nonprofit [Global Alliance for Medical Innovation](https://www.harvardgami.org/), an incubator for budding healthtech startups. Talk to me anytime about global health, technology, neuroscience, or magic tricks!
