The assignment this week was to cast something using a mold made from Sorta-Clear 37, a food-safe 2-part silicone rubber. I wanted to make some chocolate coins, since this only required a small 1-sided mold and I wanted to keep some of the Sorta-Clear for some soft robotics experiments in the future.

First, I made a dam with some scrap paper and tape to contain the silicone. I put a half-dollar inside, tail side up (I wanted to cast the tail because it has more detail).

Then, I mixed some of the Sorta-Clear together in a cup, with parts A and B in a 1:1 ratio. I poured this into the paper dam and noticed lots of bubbles.

Because I was pouring mold material over the object rather than pressing the object into the mold material, the risk of bubbles at the object-mold interface is higher. I didn't have a vacuum chamber, so I improvised by taping the guts of an old vibrating electric toothbrush on a piece of cardboard. Theoretically, this would help shake the bubbles out of the silicone.

After letting it cure overnight, I could peel away the paper and pop out the coin. The mold looks perfect! Can't say for sure how well my shaking contraption worked, but regardless I'm happy with the results.

Now it was time to melt some chocolate in the microwave. The last time I tried this I remember ending up with a burnt mess, so this time I put it on defrost mode and stirred frequently. It came out great!

To minimize mess, I used a food syringe to transfer some of the chocolate into the mold. Tapping the mold on a hard surface brought out the bubbles.

After letting the chocolate harden, I carefully popped it out. I made 2 chocolate coins this way, and I was surprised by the amount of detail captured by the mold.
