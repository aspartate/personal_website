For my final project, I have a couple of ideas revolving around robotics and control systems. I've always been fascinated with the ability of humans, through technology, to control things outside of our own body. Below are three ideas which I would like to explore.

**EEG-controlled robot.** I have this toy bluetooth-enabled EEG from a Star Wars Force Trainer kit which I had purchased a while back specifically for the purpose of doing some cool things with in terms of brain-machine interfaces. Alas, I never mustered up the courage to crack that bad boy open and start soldering things onto the circuit board. The closest I got was reading the signals from the headset via apps on my phone. In the course of my experimentation, I found that 1) the claimed EEG functionality is indeed real, and 2) the headset could detect blinks with far greater accuracy than it could detect brainwaves. This is probably because the single "read" electrode is located right at the left eyebrow, where the eyelid muscles are. In fact, the headset is capable of differentiating between
