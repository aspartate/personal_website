Here are the bugs I need to fix:
* There a picture on the home page which won't render and I can't get rid of it.
* The modals don't work in gallery mode. Also when making a new gallery post I get a weird json error, which goes away when I comment out a block of github stuff.
* When a blog post is opened, the header menu is in a weird place and covers up some of the text.
* When a blog post is opened, the next/previous navigation buttons are too close together.
* I can't get the contact form to work, not entirely sure how to get rid of it either.
